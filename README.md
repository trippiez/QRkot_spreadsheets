# Donify - Fundraising Platform

Donify is a fundraising platform designed to manage multiple target projects efficiently. It facilitates donations from users and distributes them among various projects based on priority and funding requirements.

## Project Description

Donify enables users to contribute to different projects by making donations. Each project has a title, description, and a funding goal. Once a project reaches its funding goal, it is marked as closed, and donations are then redirected to the next project in line.

## Key Features

- Multiple Target Projects
- First In, First Out Donation Principle
- User Donations: Users can make donations to the fund and view their donation history.
- Google Sheets Reporting: Automatically updates donation and project status reports in Google Sheets.

## Technologies

- FastAPI - for creating the web application.
- SQLAlchemy - ORM for working with the database.
- SQLite - database for storing links.
